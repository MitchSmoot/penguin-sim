# Mitch's wacky Penguin Simulator of DOOM!

This was my first real project that I started in my first month of learning coding. The purpose was to solidify my understanding of basic ruby code and have a little fun along the way. Apart from some bugfixes, practically all of the code was written in the first month of me learning Ruby.

The result has been the creation of a fun little adventure game that runs in the terminal. It is a single Ruby file with currently around 400 lines of code. 

The penguin simulator is more complicated that it seems to the user, with many of the Penguin's needs and biological functions being calculated in the background time passes and actions happen. These are:

1. Happiness: prevents the penguin from trying to kill you
2. Age: affects dialogue and eventually leads to old age
3. Temperature: affects happiness
4. Food in Stomach: affects hunger
5. Food in Intestines: affects potty needs


If you want the actual values to be revealed and are willing to ruin the immersion, type "debug" in the action screen.

The game is essentially turn based, revolving around the user taking an action and facing the effects... or consequences! There are multiple scenatios leading to the User's death. I will add some happier ending scenarios next time I revisit this project.
